# Development Status

## 2026-02-15
- Created `Macro/PS5/Template/Macro_I_PS5_Template.tex` — solutions template for PS5 (Misallocation and market power) with 11 questions (a–k), based on PS4 template structure. Includes optional figure placeholders for MPK/MPL distributions.
- Completed PS5 Q1 solutions (parts a–d) in `Macro/PS5/Template/Macro_I_PS5_Template.tex`: firm problem & FOCs (a), zero misallocation under identical firms (b), zero misallocation under heterogeneous productivity (c), optimal firm size/profits with DRS vs CRS efficiency discussion (d).

## 2026-02-07
- Added `Macro/PS4/ps4_part2.ipynb` implementing PS4 Section 2 Ramsey model algorithm, bisection search for `c0`, and required plots.

## 2026-02-08
- Completed PS4 Q1 solutions (parts a--d) in `Macro/PS4/Template/Macro_I_PS4_Template.tex` with FOCs, savings dynamics, steady state, and corner analysis.
